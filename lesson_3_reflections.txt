Q1] When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A1] When sharing with others it is a good idea to have it accessible and tracked in a central location to all users who may provide input.

Q2] Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A2] If you pull automatically you could cause problems with current progress you are making.  If the pull is done in the middle of your work it'll mess up what you have going.  Likely, this is undesirable for most people.
